## Having an issue?                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                               
If you're experiencing a problem with Vibe Drive, here are a few things to check first:                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                               
- **Routes not loading** — Make sure you have an active internet connection. Vibe Drive requires network access to generate routes.                                                            
- **Location not working** — Check that location permissions are enabled for Vibe Drive in Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services.                                                  
- **Start and destination too close** — Routes require at least 10 km between your starting point and destination.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                               
## Contact                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                               
If that doesn't solve it, open an issue on GitHub:

Include a description of the problem and what you were trying to do. Screenshots help.
